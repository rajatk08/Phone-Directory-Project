Phone Directory Management System with Trie Data Structure

The Phone Directory Management System is a C++ project that allows users to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage contact information using the Trie data structure. This project combines the power of Trie, OOP principles, and file handling to provide a user-friendly and efficient solution for organizing phone directory data.

FEATURES:
Trie Data Structure:
The heart of the project lies in the Trie data structure, which is utilized to store and manage contact information. Each node in the Trie represents a character in the contact's name, and the nodes are connected to form a hierarchical structure that optimizes search and retrieval operations.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
The project is designed using OOP principles, employing classes and objects to model entities such as contacts and the phone directory itself. This promotes code modularity, reusability, and maintainability.

Contact Class:
The Contact class encapsulates the properties of a contact, including name and phone number. This class provides interaction methods with contact details, such as adding, updating, and deleting contacts.

User Interface:
The project includes a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the phone directory. Users can add new contacts, search for existing ones, update contact information, and remove contacts. The interface provides clear instructions and options to guide users through the process.

File Handling:
The project incorporates file-handling techniques to ensure persistent data storage. Contacts are saved to a file when added or modified, and the data is loaded from the file when the program starts. This ensures that the contact information remains intact even after the program is closed.

Efficient Search:
The Trie data structure enables fast and efficient searching for contacts based on partial or complete names. ensures that even with a large number of contacts, the search operation remains quick and responsive.

USAGE:
Adding Contacts:
Users can add new contacts to the phone directory by providing their name, and phone number.

Searching Contacts:
The user can search for a specific contact using their name. The Trie structure optimizes the search operation, making it quick and accurate.

Updating Contacts:
If a contact's information changes, the user can easily update the contact's details, such as the phone number.

Deleting Contacts:
Users can delete contacts from the directory when they are no longer needed.

Persistent Storage:
The project ensures that all contact information is stored in a file, preventing data loss even after the program is closed.

CONCLUSION:
The Phone Directory Management System project showcases the integration of Trie data structure, OOP principles, and file handling cohesively and functionally. It provides an efficient and user-friendly solution for managing contact information, offering rapid search operations and reliable data storage. This project serves as an excellent example of how C++ programming can be used to create practical applications with advanced data structures and software engineering concepts.
